My team has their repositories as .git files in various places on the filesystem, we don't use a git server. How do you create a .git file from existing sources?

Go into source directory and do git init? It will create the .git directory in there. – birryree Apr 24 '12 at 22:32
OK so if I do a git init in my source directory, then check in and push, the result will be a .git file that others can clone? – fred basset Apr 24 '12 at 22:50
Oh, I see what you're asking about - you probably meant to do something like documentd here: jedi.be/blog/2009/05/06/8-ways-to-share-your-git-repository/… - but yes, first you need to git init, add the sources, commit, and do what's documented in that link to allow others to clone/pull from you. – birryree Apr 24 '12 at 22:54
